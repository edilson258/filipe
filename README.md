# Welcome to Filipe version 0.1 alpha 7

An interpreted, static typed, single threaded programming language powered by Rust.

Filipe still primitive and limited although it has support for:
- Arithmetic operations
- variables declaration
- if-else statments
- for-loop statments
- Native Data types `int`, `float`, `boolean`, `string`, `null`
- Built-in function `len`, `typeof`, `print`
- User defined functions

Filipe was design to be a high level programming language and beginner friendly, that why it has a clear syntax and an enhanced error reporting mechanisms.

# Examples

1. hello world
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

2. for loop and if-else statments
```python
for c in range(0, 10) {
  if (c % 2 == 0) {
    print(c, " is even")
  } else {
    print(c, " is odd")
  }
}
```

3. more examples...
```python
define sayHelloTo(name: string): null {
  print("Hello, ", name)
}

sayHelloTo("Edilson")
sayHelloTo("Mom, foo and bar")

let x = 34
let y: int = 35

define sumTwoInts(x: int, y: int): int {
  return x + y
}

print("34 + 35 = ", sumTwoInts(x, y))

for x in range(0, 10) {
  if (x % 2 == 0) {
    print(x, " is even")
  } else {
    print(x, " is odd")
  }
}

if ("hello" == "hell0") {
  print("hello and hell0 are equal")
}

print("10 has type ", typeof(10))
print("10.6 has type ", typeof(10.6))

print("Length of 'Hi Mom' is ", len("Hi Mom"))
```
